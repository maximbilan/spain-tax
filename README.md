## How It Works

### Calculation Flow

1. **Social Security Calculation**
   - Deducted from gross income: 6.35% (default, configurable)
   - This includes healthcare, unemployment, and pension contributions

2. **Allowance Calculation**
   - Personal allowance (age-based or custom)
   - Dependent allowances (children, ascendants, disabilities, family status)
   - Total allowances = Personal + Dependent allowances

3. **Taxable Income**
   - Taxable income = Income after Social Security - Total allowances

4. **IRPF Tax Calculation**
   - **State IRPF**: Progressive brackets (19%-47%)
   - **Regional IRPF**: Additional progressive brackets (varies by region, 8%-15%)
   - **Total IRPF** = State IRPF + Regional IRPF
   - **Beckham Law**: 24% flat rate on income up to €600k (if applicable)

5. **Net Income**
   - Net income = Gross income - Social Security - IRPF tax

### Tax Brackets (2024)

#### State IRPF Brackets
- €0 - €12,450: 19%
- €12,450 - €20,200: 24%
- €20,200 - €35,200: 30%
- €35,200 - €60,000: 37%
- €60,000 - €300,000: 45%
- Over €300,000: 47%

#### Regional IRPF (Examples)
- **Madrid**: 9%-14% (lower rates)
- **Catalonia**: 10%-15%
- **Valencia**: 10%-15%
- **Canary Islands**: 8%-13% (lowest rates)

### Social Security

- **Rate**: 6.35% of gross income (national, same across all regions)
- **Includes**: Healthcare, unemployment benefits, pension contributions, professional training
- **Coverage**: You and your dependents (spouse and children) are automatically covered

## Example Calculations

### Example 1: Single Person, €60,000, Madrid

```bash
./run.sh 60000 --region madrid
```

**Result:**
- Social Security: €3,810 (6.35%)
- State IRPF: €14,438.30
- Regional IRPF (Madrid): €5,398.30
- Total Tax: €23,646.60
- Net Income: €36,353.40
- Effective Rate: 39.41%

### Example 2: Family with 2 Children, €60,000, Valencia

```bash
./run.sh 60000 --children-under-3 1 --children-3-plus 1 --region valencia
```

**Result:**
- Social Security: €3,810 (6.35%)
- Dependent Allowances: €7,900
  - First child: €2,400
  - Second child (under 3): €2,700 + €2,800 (under 3 bonus) = €5,500

- Regional IRPF (Valencia): €4,877.70
- Total Tax: €20,203.00
- Net Income: €39,797.00

### Example 3: High Earner with Beckham Law, €700,000

```bash
./run.sh 700000 --beckham-law --verbose
```

**Result:**
- First €600k: 24% = €144,000
- Excess €55,550: Progressive rates = €16,255
- Total IRPF: €160,255
- Effective Rate: 29.24%
